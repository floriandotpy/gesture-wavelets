Hands
===

Circular projection and Wavelet transform on a set of images
representing hand gestures.

Just trying things for my Master thesis. Very WIP.

## Used dataset

I do not own the dataset. It originates from:
[Dr. Sebastien MARCEL - IDIAP 2001](http://www.idiap.ch/resource/gestures/)

> This is the Jochen Triesch Hand Posture Gallery.
> One can find hand postures with 3 backgrounds:
> complex, dark and light.
